## Note
This project is an assignment from my University course.
If you happen to be following the same course, or a similar  
one please keep in mind that plaigarism is penalizable. The 
reason behind the project's presence on Github is for me to 
benefit from the opinion of more experienced developers, as 
well as for others to learn from this project as much as I 
have learnt from it.
